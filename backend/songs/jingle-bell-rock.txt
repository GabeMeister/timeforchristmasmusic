Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleigh song tonight

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell rock

Come on

Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Play it again

Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is the swell time
To go riding riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

("Hey, that was great, can we do it one more time guys?"
"Here we go we're rolling")

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time it's a swell time
To go riding on a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in the jinglin' beat
That's the jungle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

What a bright time
(Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock)
It's the right time
(Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock)
Sing it again now
(Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock)
Come one now
(Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock)
Jingle, bell time
(Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock)
It's swell time
