Silent Night
Holy Night

All is calm
All is bright

Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent Night
Holy Night

Shepeards pray at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly sing hallelujah

Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
